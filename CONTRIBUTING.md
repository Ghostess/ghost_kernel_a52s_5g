# How do I submit patches to Android Common Kernels

1. BEST: Make all of your changes to upstream Linux. If appropriate, backport to the stable releases.
   These patches will be merged automatically in the corresponding common kernels. If the patch is already
   in upstream Linux, post a backport of the patch that conforms to the patch requirements below.

2. LESS GOOD: Develop your patches out-of-tree (from an upstream Linux point-of-view). Unless these are
   fixing an Android-specific bug, these are very unlikely to be accepted unless they have been
   coordinated with kernel-team@android.com. If you want to proceed, post a patch that conforms to the
   patch requirements below.

# Common Kernel patch requirements

- All patches must conform to the Linux kernel coding standards and pass `script/checkpatch.pl`
- Patches shall not break gki_defconfig or allmodconfig builds for arm, arm64, x86, x86_64 architectures
(see  https://source.android.com/setup/build/building-kernels)
- If the patch is not merged from an upstream branch, the subject must be tagged with the type of patch:
`UPSTREAM:`, `BACKPORT:`, `FROMGIT:`, `FROMLIST:`, or `ANDROID:`.
- All patches must have a `Change-Id:` tag (see https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-changeid.html)
- If an Android bug has been assigned, there must be a `Bug:` tag.
- All patches must have a `Signed-off-by:` tag by the author and the submitter

Additional requirements are listed below based on patch type

## Requirements for backports from mainline Linux: `UPSTREAM:`, `BACKPORT:`

- If the patch is a cherry-pick from Linux mainline with no changes at all
    - tag the patch subject with `UPSTREAM:`.
    - add upstream commit information with a `(cherry-picked from ...)` line
    - Example:
        - if the upstream commit message is
```
        important patch from upstream

        This is the detailed description of the important patch
